# Directed Weighted Graph

In this project we wrote a code for getting graphs from json file and save them after implementing some functions.

Features of our algorithm :
- Reading graphs from json file.
- Checking if the graph is storngly connected.
- Checking what is the shortest path from first node to last node.
- Giving the shortest path from src node to dest node (with nodes which in the 'road').
- Saving the graph after calculation it with some algorithms to make it more efficient. 
- Checking tsp(with Hemilton Circle).
- Calculation the center of the graph (the most close node to the all other nodes).
- Showing the graph in gui window with some menu options.

In this code we used Dijkstra Algorithm to find if the graph is connected and get the shortest path.
