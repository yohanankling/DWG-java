# directed weighted graph
in this project we wrote a code for getting graph from json file and save them after implementing some functions.
feature of our algorithm :
- read graphs from json file
- check if the graph is storngly connected
- check what is the sorthest path from node to another
- give the shortest path from src node to destination node (with the nodes that in in the 'road')
- save the graph after calculate him with some algorithm to make him more efficient 
- check tsp(with hemilton circle)
- calculate the center of the graph (the most close node to the all other node)
- to show the graph in gui window with some menu option
in this code we used dijkstra algorithm to find if the graph is connected and get the shortest path.
